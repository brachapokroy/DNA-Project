This project is about DNA sequences that on their data all types of commands are implemented.In the project there is an interface Icommand of whom all commands inherit from him and that enforces them to implement the function execute for every command.The interaction between the user and the project is gone through the CLI class where it's job is to get commands from the user then send them to factory class where factory builds an object of the command type that was accepted and runs it by it's execute function.The CLI may also change to batch mode by the batch command and then the commands will be sent to the batch class where a new object of the batch will be and the CLI will also be able to accept a run batch command where it will be sent to factory class to implement the batch commands.
